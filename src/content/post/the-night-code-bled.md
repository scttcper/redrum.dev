## The Night Code Bled

There are some things that should stay buried in the depths of version control. Some codebases that should never see the light of day again. But curiosity, that damned curiosity, always gets the better of us developers.

It was 3 AM when I first encountered the codebase. A legacy system, they said. "Just needs a quick maintenance update," they said. The previous developer had left the company abruptly, leaving behind only cryptic comments and a README file that read simply: "DO NOT WAKE THE SLEEPING FUNCTIONS."

## The Descent

The first sign something was wrong came when I tried to understand the main application loop. Variables with names like `soul_collector` and `blood_memory` scattered throughout. Comments in what appeared to be Latin. And functions that seemed to call themselves recursively into infinity.

```javascript
function summon_entity(entity_type, sacrifice_count) {
    if (sacrifice_count > 0) {
        // Hic sunt dracones
        return summon_entity(entity_type, sacrifice_count - 1)
               + extract_essence(entity_type);
    }
    return undefined; // or does it?
}
```

## When Debugging Becomes Exorcism

What started as a simple bug fix became a journey into digital hell. Each line of code I touched seemed to awaken something deeper in the system. Error messages appeared in languages that didn't exist. The CPU usage would spike at exactly midnight. And sometimes, just sometimes, I swear I could hear the hard drive whispering.

The worst part? The code worked. Perfectly. Every horror-inducing line of it served a purpose that became clear only after staring into the abyss long enough.

Some code isn't meant to be refactored. Some legacy systems are legacy for a reason.

I closed the laptop and walked away. Some demons are better left sleeping.
