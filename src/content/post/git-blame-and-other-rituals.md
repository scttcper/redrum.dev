## Git Blame & Other Rituals

Every developer knows the dread. That moment when you run `git blame` on a particularly troublesome piece of code, hoping to find answers, only to discover that you're staring at your own commit from three months ago. The timestamp reads 4:47 AM, and you have absolutely no memory of writing any of it.

## The Summoning Circle

Version control systems aren't just tools—they're digital séances. Each commit is a ritual, each merge a summoning. We invoke the spirits of past developers, channeling their intentions through cryptic commit messages:

```
"fixed stuff"
"this should work now"
"DO NOT TOUCH THIS CODE"
"why does this even work?"
"I'm sorry"
```

These aren't messages—they're incantations. Desperate pleas to future developers (often ourselves) who will inevitably disturb this carefully balanced digital ecosystem.

## The Archaeology of Terror

Every `git log` is an archaeological expedition into madness. You dig through layers of commits, each one revealing another level of desperation:

- Last week: Clean, well-documented changes
- Last month: Comments getting sparse, variable names getting cryptic
- Six months ago: Comments in multiple languages, including what appears to be ancient Sumerian
- One year ago: A single commit message: "It begins."

## The Curse of Knowledge

The worst part isn't the bad code—it's the good code that you can't understand anymore. That elegant solution you crafted in a caffeine-fueled midnight coding session that works perfectly but defies all logical explanation. You've become afraid of your own creation.

## Breaking the Cycle

Some say the only way to break the curse is to leave detailed commit messages, comprehensive documentation, and clean, readable code. But we all know the truth: there will always be that one commit, usually at 3 AM, usually under deadline pressure, that will haunt the repository forever.

The commit history remembers everything. Even the things we'd rather forget.

Especially the things we'd rather forget.
